CIF-DB

https://github.com/collectiveintel/cif-db

Currently, for non-Java access to HBase, you need to go thru a Thrift layer. This adds latency.
Also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4586
And [jira] [HBASE-5295] Improve the Thrift API to switch on/off writing to wal for Mutations".

Misc, http://hbase.apache.org/book/perf.writing.html#perf.hbase.client.putwal
Misc, http://hstack.org/hbase-performance-testing/

So C, C++, Python access to HBase are slow. 

So, cif-db will be likely be in Java
