# We use a generic table for caching raw objects
create 'cif', 'gen'

# we will store the complete CIF.msg object keyed as
# 'timestamp-hash' 
#
# eg
#
# put 'cif', '8589938385-48af43de', 'gen:object', '[serialized protobuf]'
#
# putting the ts first groups messages into regions by time (generally)
# 



# We'll precreate tables for 'canned' message types.
# Each table is named after the specific message type
# and we will explode the message fields into columns
# the exploding will be done by a background process
# so as to not slow down the main thread
